                As women age and reach the age of 40, they often let go of long-held body image issues and emotional wounds, and instead focus on their own sexuality. This can result in some of the best sex they have ever had, as they feel more comfortable and confident in their bodies and desires. Many women also find that they have more time and resources to explore their sexuality, and may even prioritize it in their lives. It's important for women to remember that their libido does not necessarily diminish after menopause, and that sex does not have to be solely about their partner's pleasure. Instead, women can focus on their own pleasure and desires, and learn to speak up about what they want in the bedroom. It's also important to remember that sex can involve more than just intercourse and orgasm, and that exploring different sensations and techniques can lead to increased pleasure. Using lubricant and being open to new experiences can also enhance pleasure. Overall, sex after 50 can be enjoyable and fulfilling, and a time for women to embrace their erotic autonomy and explore their desires.

              <p>
                As a 40 year old woman, you may find that your focus has shifted towards exploring your own sexual pleasure and discovering what feels good for you. This can be a time of exciting self-discovery and liberation, as you let go of any preconceived notions about what sexuality should be and instead focus on your own desires and needs. Here are a few tips on how to explore sexual pleasure as a 40 year old woman:
            </p>

                   <h3><b>1. Be gentler and more sensual with how you approach pleasure: </b></h3>
                   <p>
                    I felt that for a long time sex had been caught up in speedy routines, me often being moved around like an Ikea sofa. I wanted to break sex down to put it back together again, learn how and where I liked to be touched, and similarly how to touch a man. I was a bit terrified of the penis, not really sure what I was supposed to do with it. And I wanted to really explore my own pleasure. I read somewhere that women are capable of 14 different types of orgasm. If this was true, I’d been seriously underperforming. I also finally admitted just how much I hated, truly hated, my body, the very vessel I wanted to give me pleasure.
                    My masturbatory habits completely changed. Gone was the quickie to internet porn; instead I spent time tuning into how and where my body wanted to be touched. Sometimes a tender touch on my yoni (the tantric term for the vulva and vagina) could move me to tears, bringing back memories of times when, either with lovers or medical professionals, this area was not so cared for. The more this healing happened, the more my capacity for pleasure increased, something that frequently blew my mind. One particularly powerful orgasm felt as though I spent minutes spinning through space and time. Ripples of this orgasm were still ricocheting through my body two days later. I have given that one the name, “the orgasm that could create world peace”.
               </p>
                
               <h3><b>2. Reclaim your sexuality</b></h3>
               <p>
                I went to my first sex festival and loved it. Well, I was pretty terrified at first and may have locked myself in my car on the first night, but once I made it out of there I met other like-minded people and had some beautiful experiences, including with other women who, like me, were feeling that they weren’t quite as straight as they had thought.

I got much better at the important stuff; stating my boundaries and mastering how to initiate and ask for what I desired. I finally trusted my ability to say “no”, and it was liberating. I think because I was stronger in this way, I was able to try things that might have terrified me before, such as sex parties.

Perhaps the richest gift my sexual adventure gave me was empowerment. I learned that my sexuality is just that: mine. I think before, in my passivity, I had been waiting for someone else to unlock it or give me what I thought I needed. Previously I’d just taken it for granted that I was the problem. My body was wrong, I was wrong. So caught up in my shame and failings, I hadn’t stepped back to see that society’s teachings around sex were pretty rotten. With my new sense of freedom and power I stood up to the Sun over Page 3, starting a petition that grew into a national campaign and was (after two-and-a-half years) ultimately successful. The insecure woman I was before my sexual capering would never have had the confidence to stand up publicly on an issue like that.

               <h3><b>3. Eat Right:</b></h3>
               <p>
                   Certain foods can help boost your libido. Oysters, chocolate, avocados, and nuts are all known to have libido-enhancing properties. So go ahead and indulge in a little bit of these tasty treats.
           </p>
           <h3><b>4. Dress Up:</b></h3>
           <p>
           Never ever underestimate the power of a see-through teddy to wake up your inner-goddess (and get your motor running). Whether you are a married woman or you have started dating recently, it is crucial that you get the basics right. This means you should invest in sexy lingerie, because you might never know when you require these. A hot piece of lingerie can reignite the flames of love and romance in your relationship and help establish a lasting connection with one another. So plan nights out with your husband or potential partner and surprise him with appealing lingerie to let him know that the effort has been made for him.

           <h3><b>7.Consider Your Medications: </b></h3>
           <p>
               Some medications, such as antidepressants or blood pressure medications, can affect your libido. If you're taking medication and experiencing a decreased sex drive, talk to your healthcare provider about potential side effects and alternative treatment options.
           </p>
           <h3><b>8. Get Enough Sleep</b></h3>
           <p>
               Lack of sleep can lead to low energy levels and decreased desire for intimacy. Make sure to get enough rest to help boost your energy and mood.
           </p>
           <h3><b>9. Try Natural Remedies</b></h3>
           <p>
               Some people find that certain herbs or supplements, such as <a href="https://amzn.to/3WyuSJd" target="_blank">horny goat weed</a> or <a href="https://amzn.to/3G99qTU" target="_blank">maca root</a>, can help increase their libido. However, it's important to speak with a healthcare provider before trying any new remedies to make sure they are safe and appropriate for you.
           </p>
           <h3><b>10. Consider Your Relationship</b></h3>
           <p>
               If you're feeling disconnected from your partner or experiencing relationship issues, it can affect your desire for intimacy. In this case, it may be helpful to work on improving communication and building a stronger emotional connection with your partner.

           </p>
           <h3><b>11. Seek Therapy</b></h3>
           <p>
                If you're struggling with low libido or other sexual issues and can't seem to find a solution on your own, it may be helpful to seek the guidance of a mental health professional. A therapist can help you identify and address any underlying emotional or psychological issues that may be affecting your sex life.
           </p>
           <h3><b>12. Practice Mindfulness</b></h3>
           <p>
               Paying attention to your body and your surroundings in the present moment can help increase your awareness and appreciation of sensual pleasure. This can be as simple as focusing on your breath or paying attention to your senses as you go about your day.
           </p>
           <h3><b>13. Try Sensual Touch</b></h3>
           <p>
               Massages, baths, or other types of sensual touch can be a great way to relax and get in the mood. Consider trying different types of touch, such as using essential oils or trying out different massage techniques, to find what works best for you.
           </p>
           <h3><b>14. Take Breaks</b></h3>
           <p>
               Ironic as it sounds, sometimes, taking a break from sexual activity can actually increase your desire for it. Consider taking a break from intimacy for a short period of time and then building up the anticipation by engaging in non-sexual activities, such as flirting or foreplay.
